Bean Scope
@Scope(
1.Singleton -> only one instance of a bean is created per IOC throughout its the entire life cycle

2.Prototype scope -> a new instance is created every time this object is requested from IOC container useful for components that are being
  used temporarily

3.Request -> a new bean instance  is created for each HTTP Request and destroyed ounce the request is completed useful for storing
 request of specific data in web applications.

 4.Session -> a new bean instance  is created for each HTTP Session and destroyed ounce the Session is completed
 )

 FlyWay library is used to script our database  so that this db can be recreated across different environment and we can version and track changes
 over time for consistency and reliability

 Lombok library is used to simply code or used to reduce boiler plates code it provide us with annotations and we can use this annotations to
 instruct intellji to automatically generate getters ,setterrs ,allArgsConstrctor,tostring at compile time

 Understanding Entity State
 1.when we create entity using new Key Word then its state is Transient(temporary) then when we call save method of Repository is state
 translate to Persistence and get added to Persistence Context Container (Working Memory of Hibernate) then hibernate will save that Object in the
 Database and Database will Assign Id TO THIS Object and Hibernate will store that ID in our Entity so this object will not stay forever in memory
 when the job is done it will be detached Entity from memory
 If we have Detached Entity and Make Changes to it then that detached entity will get added to Persistence Context then it will Transition to
 Persistence state and Hibernate will save the Changes
 when we try to Delete Entity then that Entity will Transition to Removed State  then Hibernate will remove that entity from db and this entity will became transient again
