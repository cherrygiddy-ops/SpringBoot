Mastering Spring Boot: Building APIs
Building the Login API
In this exercise, you’ll create a login endpoint that accepts a user’s credentials and
checks if they’re valid. This is your first step toward implementing authentication.
For now, we’ll keep things simple—your endpoint should return an empty response with
the right status to indicate if credentials are correct. We’ll handle JWTs in a later lesson.
Example Request:
Example Response:
• If credentials are invalid, return 401 UNAUTHORIZED.
• If successful, return 200 OK.
POST /auth/login
{
"email": "user1@domain.com",
"password": "123456"
}
